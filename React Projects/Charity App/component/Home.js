      <p>We are a non-profit organization dedicated to helping those in need.</p>
      <p>The main aim of oue charity website is to provide the education for the girl child inorder to achieve the <span>"BETI BACHAO BETI PADHAO"</span>.</p>
      <p>Sex-selective abortion or female foeticide has led to a sharp drop in the ratio of girls born in contrast to boy infants in some states in India.<br/> Ultrasound technology has made it possible for pregnant women and their families to learn the sex of a foetus early in a pregnancy. <br/>Discrimination against girl infants, for several reasons, has combined with the technology to result in a rise in abortions of foetuses identified as female during ultrasonic testing.</p>
      <p>The average female literacy rate throughout the world is 79.9%, while for men it is 89.2%. India lingers behind at 62.3% for women as compared to 80% for men. Many girls in India are married at a young age and drop out of school after they complete their primary education due to societal pressures or early pregnancies. </p>
      <p>Hence we as an organisation come forward to help these girl children </p>
